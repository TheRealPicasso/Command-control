# CommandControls v1.0.1

## 🎉 New Features

### Hidden Commands
- Added `hidden_commands` configuration option
- Commands in this list will **work** when typed but will **not appear** in tab-complete suggestions
- Perfect for hiding the "real" command when you want players to use aliases instead
- Example: Hide `/sidebar` so players use `/sb` instead

### Command Aliases Support
- Added `aliases` configuration option
- Define shorthand commands that map to their target commands
- If a player can use an alias, they can also use the target command (and vice versa)
- Bidirectional alias resolution - works both ways

### Improved Sync Protocol
- Enhanced client-server sync to include hidden commands
- Client now properly filters hidden commands from suggestions while still allowing execution

## 🔧 Improvements

- Added `_hidden_info` comment to default config explaining hidden commands feature
- Aliases section added to default generated config
- Better debug logging showing exactly which commands are sent to each player
- Improved alias resolution in permission checks

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed aliases not appearing in tab-complete suggestions
- Fixed command tree not including alias targets when only alias is allowed
- Fixed sync packet not matching command tree contents

## 📝 Configuration Changes

New configuration options added:

```json
{
  "hidden_commands": [
    "sidebar"
  ],
  "aliases": {
    "sb": "sidebar",
    "b": "balance"
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Both server AND client** need to be updated to this version for hidden commands to work correctly
- Existing configs will continue to work - new options are optional
- Delete your old `commands.json` to regenerate with new default structure, or add the new fields manually
